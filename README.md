Githype
=======

Githype - A Tweetdeck-like web application for real time monitoring and notification of Github repositories. 

Githype should:
* Allow users to sign in with their Github account.
* Allow users to track events on specified Github repositories. Events iuncluding:
    * Commits.
    * Merges
    * Pull requests
    * Changes to file X
    * Branch creation/deletion
    * Forks
    * Releases
    * Events from specific Github users.
    * Issues opened, closed, modified.
    * When user is assigned an issue.
    * Milestones.
    * Much more that I haven't thought about yet.
* Allow users to choose to be notified of certain events of their choosing.
* Allow users to reply to issues from Githype.
* Githype remembers a users configuration for the next time they log in.

Githype will probably end up looking similar to Tweetdeckâ€™s column configuration allowing multiple columns to be filtered, have notifcations on and other features.

Githype should be easy for a user to deploy on their own hosting solution and reasonably easy to maintain and configure.

Support for other Git remote sites/platforms such as Bitbucket, Gitlab and cgit may be added in the future and is something I certainly would like to offer.
