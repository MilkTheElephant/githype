Githype
=======


Githype is a tweetdeck-like always updating timeline for Github (other services too, at some point) showing, in real time, commits made to repos, pull requests, issues, and other events.
Users may set up notifications on certain events so they can stay productive while waiting on other contributors. e.g When user X next commits to repo Y. Or when branch X gets merged with branch Y
